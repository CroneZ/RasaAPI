Your package continues to travel to its destination despite the time between the tracking events. Depending on the destination, it could also take time to arrive in the destination country due to the distance and transit time of the selected service.\n Your shipment might also be delayed. Delivery delays can be caused by weather events, customs or operational backlogs.
